<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![](screen1.png)

The web version of GoBarber, an application for service providers, such as Barbers, to control customer schedules. This application consumes the [Gobarber API](https://github.com/Torres-ssf/gobarber-backend). This web version is designed to be used by providers, they can create and log into their accounts. Once logged in, they will be redirected to the dashboard, where they can find all the information related to the current day's appointments as well as for future appointments. Customers can use the mobile version of this application to create appointments with their favorite providers. This application was designed during the GoStack bootcamp.
